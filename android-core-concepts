1. Compose Core Concepts:
- Understanding of Composable functions and their lifecycle
- State management in Compose (remember, mutableStateOf, rememberSaveable)
- Recomposition and side effects (LaunchedEffect, DisposableEffect)
- Performance optimization in Compose

2. Architecture with Compose:
- How to structure a Compose-based application
- Integration with ViewModels and state handling
- Unidirectional data flow implementation
- Navigation in Compose applications

3. Advanced Compose Topics:
- Custom layouts and modifiers
- Composition local and providing dependencies
- Theming and styling in Compose
- Animation implementations
- State hoisting patterns

4. Testing:
- Unit testing Composable functions
- UI testing with Compose
- Integration testing strategies
- Testing state management

5. Migration and Interoperability:
- Strategies for migrating from XML-based Views to Compose
- Handling legacy code alongside Compose
- Integration between Compose and traditional View system

6. Performance:
- Compose rendering optimization
- Memory management
- Preventing unnecessary recompositions
- Smart recomposition strategies

7. Real-world Scenarios:
- Handling complex UI states
- Implementation of design systems
- Error handling and edge cases
- Accessibility implementation
- Handling configuration changes

8. System Design:
- Designing scalable Compose-based features
- Component reusability
- State management for large applications
- Architecture patterns (MVI/MVVM with Compose)

Specific Technical Challenges Might Include:
1. Building a custom UI component with specific requirements
2. Implementing a complex animation
3. Solving state management problems
4. Creating responsive layouts that handle different screen sizes
5. Implementing efficient lists with LazyColumn/LazyRow
6. Handling complex user interactions

Remember to:
- Focus on performance implications of your solutions
- Consider edge cases and error states
- Think about scalability and maintainability
- Be prepared to explain your architectural decisions
- Demonstrate knowledge of Compose best practices
