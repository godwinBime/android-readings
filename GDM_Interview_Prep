You should be ready to discuss:
=========================

● State Management: Modern design patterns for managing application data and UI
states, and platform-specific frameworks.

● Performance: Strategies for building fast and responsive user experiences, through
various optimization techniques and a solid understanding of view lifecycle and
rendering pipelines.

● Concurrency: Management of background work using modern, platform-specific
concurrency frameworks like Kotlin Coroutines or Swift Concurrency.

● Memory: Platform-specific memory models (e.g., Garbage Collection in Kotlin vs. ARC
in Swift) and strategies for identifying and resolving memory leaks.


How to prepare:
● Solidify CS Fundamentals: Be proficient in common Data Structures and Algorithms
and be prepared to analyze their complexity.

● Focus on Application Architecture: Prepare to architect a complex, user-facing
application. This involves discussing your high-level approach to managing application
state, designing the client-server communication layer, and ensuring a performant user
experience.

● Practice Trade-off Analysis: For any design decision you propose, the most critical skill
is your ability to articulate the "why" by clearly explaining the trade-offs of your chosen
approach versus the other
